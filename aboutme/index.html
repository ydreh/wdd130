    <h2>Herdy Rodriguez</h2>
    <p>I'm from Venezuela, but I'm living in Montreal, Canada for around 4 years now.
        I'm currently working as a data annotator for Algolux, we are working on a software
        solution through machine learning to achieve the goal of a self-driving car.
    </p>
    <p>One of the thing I love most is always learn something new, I like to learn new languages,
        I currently speak 3 ( Spanish, English and French) but I want to learn some more,
        I currently learning Korean. The music is one of my hobbies, I play the piano, guitar, and the trumpet,
        one of things that I have learn through my learning path, is that the time is a key element,
        you have to give yourself the time to learn something,
        understand a subject can be difficult but with the enough
        time can be done in the right way, so that's why I always plan ahead
        and give myself plenty of time to understand and achieve my goals.</p>
    <p>I'm pursuing the bachelor’s degree in applied technology, I was raised in the church, one of the my favorite
        quotes
        is from President Heber J. Grant, he often quoted the following statement, which is sometimes attributed to Ralph
        Waldo Emerson:
        “That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do—not that the nature of the thing is changed, but
        that our power to do is increased.” </p>
